    <h3>Idea:</h3>
    <p>My Idea is Simple to Build an ML Application and deploy at cloud server, cloud service is would be cheap and low cost, after workaround i found 
    <a href="http://heroku.com/"> Heroku Cloud Sevice</a>,  here we can deploy up to 5 apps as free after that it'll be paid.</p>
    <p>So I started with a 'Hello World' project of neural network i.e Handwritten digits recognition. worked with this problem using various ML Library's like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch but these are not tested with real-time data, developed models using MNIST provided Test and Train Data, find performance matrix, accuracy, etc. but this time I want to test my model with Real-Time Data and Application should available to others also. </p>
    <p>
      The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.
      <bt/>
      It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
      <br/>
      The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.
    </p>
    <h4>Initial Requirement:</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>UI for the Handwritten digits</li>
        <li>Machine Learning Library for Easy to build Neural Network</li>
        <li>Backend-Server to Manage the inputs from UI</li>
        <li>Cloud Service - Cheap and Low Cost</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h5>UI for the Handwritten digits</h5>
    <p>HTML Canvas provides the Paint like feature to draw something at the browser window and you can save or send it to backend-server as an image through canvas toDataURL object. this object consists of data of base64 format send this data to the backend and create the image either .png/jpeg or any other image readable format.</p>

    <h5>Machine Learning Library for Easy to build Neural Network</h5>
    <p>Haing knowledge on various ML Library's, i'd preper to build neural network with Keras as TensorFlow Backend.</p>
    <p><b>Keras</b> is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.</p>
    <p>
      Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
        </li>
        <li>
          Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
        </li>
        <li>
          Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h5>Backend-Server to Manage the inputs from UI</h5>
    <p><b>Flask</b> is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.
